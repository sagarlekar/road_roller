Road Roller manipulates spatial data for Roads Networks. 
Spatial data for roads is usually distributed as shapefiles with LINESTRINGs. Converting continuous data (LINESTRING) to discrete points (POINT) will make it suitable for running Agent Based Simulations, especially in transportation and motion simulations.

Road Roller does the following
1) Converts roads into 'n' points separated by a distance 'd'
2) Creates a new lane 'l' for a given road at a distance 'd
